#100 DAYS OF CODE CHALLENGE

Day 1 - Refreshed HTML & CSS & Bootstrap

Day 2 - Finished Javascript & DOM Manipulation & Did a Todo List Exercise

Day 3 - Built a Simple Background Changer - Tried my hand at React for the first time, concluded that I need to brush up on more advanced Javascript Syntax because I was getting lost in the code.
